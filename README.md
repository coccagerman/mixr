# mixr

Mixr is a cocktails app, where users can explore cocktail recipes shared by other users and post their own.

This was my first project built with react native. I used it to learn about react native, react navigation and typescript.

Characteristics:
* Developed with react-native and typescript
* State management with Redux
* Navigation with react navigation
* Authentication with Firebase
* Data persistance with Firestore (Firebase NoSql database)
* Usage of device features (camera)

Main features:
* User can register and login with Google, Facebook or Twiter accounts
* User can publish cocktail recipes, and search for other published recipes
* User can upvote a recipe and add it to favorites section
* User can navigate through other user's profile
